This project is based on MVVM architecture, and implemented Android Architecture Components. There are two pages, list page, which is displaying a list and a detail page which displays the detail of selected item.

It fetches data from http://codingchallenge.nine.com.au/sample_request.json, which is a JSON object, and then parses this JSON object into data classes with Moshi.

The data would be saved in a LiveData and binding with the view with DataBinding.
